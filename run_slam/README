QUBICC SLAM Experiments on Mistral
----------------------------------
Marco Giorgetta, MPI-M, April 2019

This is a first set of test experiments for the idealized QBO simulations
on a spherically limited area model (slam) setup. This setup uses the r02b07
grid on a sphere with radius r_Earth/8 so that the metric resolution is
20 km / 8 = 2.5 km, as targetted for the realistic QBO simulation. Thus the
number of cells is reduced by a factor of 8^2=64. For the vertical a 191 level
grid is used, which extends up to ~83 km. The time step is 20s.

Test experiments are made for:

Two time periods:
- "t1m": 3 time steps with time step output
- "10d": 10 days with hourly output in daily files and daily restarts

And these configurations:
- slam                     : the empty time loop
- slam_dyn_tra             : dynamics + transport
- slam_dyn_tra_nop         : dynamics + transport + dyn-phy-interface, but no params.
- slam_dyn_tra_psr         : dynamics + transport + "PSRAD"   radiation
- slam_dyn_tra_vdf         : dynamics + transport + "vdiff"   vertical diffusion
- slam_dyn_tra_cld         : dynamics + transport + "echam"   cloud micro-physics
- slam_dyn_tra_mig         : dynamics + transport + "graupel" cloud micro-physics (1)
- slam_dyn_tra_psr_vdf_cld : dynamics + transport + "PSRAD"   radiation
                                                  + "vdiff"   vertical diffusion
                                                  + "echam"   cloud micro-physics

(1) "graupel" cloud micro-physics produces no precip over 10 days

Code used:
icon-aes:icon-aes-mig #90db8107cc1a24ab6e2572ef2808a3d5651fa5b6

Changes later committed to:
icon-aes:icon-aes-slaminit #9e77d1e598dd332182a9c3ae3b7f0d815f1f6af9

Note: By error the executable used did not include all changes of #9e77d1. This
      This had the side effect of using the standard Earth rotation instead of
      no rotation. With the correct executable no rotation would be used and
      results therefore would be different.
      Therefore the executable ("icon") is stored in the experiment folder
      of the experiment "slam_dyn_tra_psr_vdf_cld".

Experiments are stored in:

Update 26.4.2019

- exp.r02b07l191_slam_dyn_tra_psr_vdf_cld_300d added
  This experiment was initially set to run for 300 days,
  but later shortened to 180 days.

- exp.r02b04l191_slam*_t1m experiments added
  The only differences between the r02b04 and r02b07 versions consist in the
  grids and in the number of output PEs, which is set to 1 in the r02b04 setups
  instead of the number of output files in the r02b07 setups.

- The following experiments are run with the "new" code specified below:
-- all "t1m" experiments for r02b04 and r02b07
-- exp.r02b07l191_slam_dyn_tra_psr_vdf_cld_10d
-- exp.r02b07l191_slam_dyn_tra_psr_vdf_cld_300d

Code used:
icon-aes:icon-aes-integrate-qubicc-1 #f4eba5bd7f375b7f885cacb594aadb8e47ccfcd6
