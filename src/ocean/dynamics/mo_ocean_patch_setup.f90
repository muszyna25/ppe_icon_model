!!
!!               The module <i>mo_model_import_domain</i>
!! provides functionality to import information about the models computational
!! domain. This information is read from several files that were generated by
!! the patch_2D generator programm. The data types describing the model domain are
!! contained in <i>mo_domain_model</i>.
!!
!! @par Revision History
!! Initial version  by: Peter Korn,  MPI-M, Hamburg, June 2005
!! Modification by Thomas Heinze (2006-02-21):
!! - renamed m_modules to mo_modules
!! Modification by Thomas Heinze (2006-09-20):
!! - added routine grid_and_patch_diagnosis
!! Modification by Pilar Ripodas, DWD, (2007-01-31)
!! - addapted to the new TYPE grid_edges (tangent_orientation added)
!! Modification by Peter Korn,  MPI-M, (2006-12)
!! - implementation of topography and boundary treatment, i.e.
!!   initialization of the grid & patch_2D components that carry
!!   information about topography and the lateral boundaries of
!!   the domain; this is not related to patch_2D boundaries.
!!   topography can either be computed by analytical l,eans or
!!   by reading from database files.
!! Modification by Hui Wan, MPI-M, (2007-02-23)
!! - Subroutine <i>init_import</i> was changed to <i>setup_grid</i>.
!!   Namelist hierarchy_ini was renamed to <i>grid_ctl</i>, moved
!!   from <i>mo_io_utilities</i> to this module and now read from
!!   an external file in subroutine <i>setup_grid</i>.
!! - Some changes in <i>init_ocean_patch_component</i> after
!!   discussion with Peter.
!! - Calculation of the min. primal edge length was added to
!!   <i>import_patches</i>. However, shouldn't it be an array with
!!   one element for each patch_2D, rather than a scalar?
!! Modification by P. Ripodas, DWD, (2007-03-14):
!! - Now the output of "import_patches" is the min_dual_edge_lenght
!!   instead of the min_primal_edge_lenght. It will be used to set
!!   the horizontal diffusion parameter. Now it is done as it was
!!   in the prototype.
!! Modification by Almut Gassmann, MPI-M (2007-04)
!! - removed loptimize to make compatible with new grid generator
!! - removed itoa for good programming style
!! - reorganized patch_2D input to be compatible with the new patch_2D generator
!! - cleaning up "destruct_patches"
!! Modification by Almut Gassmann, MPI-M (2007-04-13)
!! - remove grid type and perform related adaptations
!!   (grid information comes now inside a patch_2D)
!! - changed subroutine name form setup_grid to setup_files
!! Modified by Hui Wan, MPI-M, (2008-04-04)
!!  - topography_file_dir renamed topo_file_dir
!!  - for the hydro_atmos, control variable testtype renamed ctest_name.
!! Modified by Almut Gassmann, MPI-M, (2008-04-23)
!!  - itopo distinguishes now shallow water (itopo=1) orography function
!!    from hydro_atmos orography function (itopo=2)
!! Modification by Jochen Foerstner, DWD, (2008-07-16)
!!  - new fields in the derived type for the edges:
!!    grid_edges%primal_cart_normal (Cartesian normal to edge),
!!    grid_edges%quad_idx, grid_edges%quad_area and grid_edges%quad_orientation
!!    (indices of edges and area of the quadrilateral formed by two adjacent cells)
!!    up to now these new fields are initialized in the new routines
!!    calculate_primal_cart_normal and init_quad_twoadjcells
!!    rather than read from a grid/patch_2D file.
!! Modification by Almut Gassmann, MPI-M, (2008-09-21)
!!  - remove reference to mask and height files, they are never used
!!  - use cell_type to distinguish cells as triangles or hexagons
!!  LL: this is done by reading directly the dual grid
!! Modification by Almut Gassmann, MPI-M (2008-10-30)
!!  - add subroutine init_coriolis to initialize Coriolis parameter
!! Modification by Constantin Junk, MPI-M (2011-04-05)
!! - ...
!! Modification by Daniel Reinert, DWD (2012-04-11)
!!  - new routine which initializes the butterfly data structure
