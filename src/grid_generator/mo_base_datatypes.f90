!!  Contains the definition of basic used defined data types
!!  to store information about the grid in the INTERNAL grid representation
!!  used by the grid generator.  In particular,
!!  types for triangles, edges and vertices are defined.
!!  This representation is not convenient for
!!  use by the numerical model since edge and vertex entities are replicated
!!  for each grid cell.

  ! Definition of several basic data types:
  !
  ! The definitions consits of several basic components. First of all
  ! is the definition of the edges and vertices. They are build by two major
  ! components. One is the informational part. The other part is the associated
  ! geometry. the whole triangle object does contain as well the topology and graph
  ! informations to its neighbors in all topological directions.
  !
  ! Note: in general it would be nice to have the pure topological information in
  !       mo_topology and the data types extended in mo_geometry, but that will
  !       only be available within the next Fortran standard.
