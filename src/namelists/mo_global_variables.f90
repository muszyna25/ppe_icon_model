!!
!! @par Revision History
!!  Initial version  by Luca Bonaventura (2005).
!!  Modification by Thomas Heinze (2006-02-21):
!!  - renamed m_modules to mo_modules
!!  Modification by Thomas Heinze (2006-05-04):
!!  - changed nerr to nerror to avoid conflict with nerr: error output unit
!!  Modification by Peter Korn, MPI-M (2007-02):
!!  - ocean parameters introduced.
!!  - topography_selection introduced.
!!  Modification by Hui Wan, MPI-M (2007-02-23):
!!  Reorganization:
!!  - declaration of namelists moved to here from <i>mo_io_utilities</i>.
!!  - changed the names of the namelists.
!!  - subroutine <i>setup_control</i> and <i>setup_dyn</i> introduced
!!    to parse namelist <i>run_ctl</i> and <i>dyn_ctl, ocean_ctl</i>.
!!    The contents were parts of subroutine <i>init_dyn</i> and
!!    <i>check_initialization</i> in <i>mo_io_utilities</i>.
!!  Modification by Hui Wan, MPI-M (2007-11)
!!  - added additional namelist variables for additional smoothing to
!!    divergence operator.
!!  - Comment: CFL number of horizontal diffusion needs to be checked
!!    for the three-time-level schemes.
!!  Modification by Hui Wan, MPI-M (2008-02-04)
!!  - added namelist variable <i>dt_hdiff</i> which is the user-specified
!!    time step for horizontal diffusion
!!  Modification by Hui Wan, MPI-M (2008-04-04)
!!  - loce renamed locean
!!  - topography_selection renamed itopo
!!  - default value of nproma set to 1
!!  - dt renamed dtime
!!  - modtype renamed itime_scheme
!!  - difftype renamed hdiff_order
!!  - modtype_hdiff renamed hdiff_time_scheme
!!  - efold renamed hdiff_efold
!!  Modification by Almut Gassman, MPI-M (2008-09-19)
!!  - switch lshallow_water introduced with intention to have only one
!!    executable for atmosphere and shallow water
!!  - switch lidealized for using artificial model generated initial data
!!  - switch for running options as triangular or hexagonal model
!!  Modification by A. Gassmann, MPI-M (2008-09-23)
!!  - clean namelists and removed not necessary variables
!!  - rename this subroutine in mo_global_variables
!!    (no reference to shallow water any longer)
!!  - rename theta in si_2tls
!!  Modification by A. Gassmann, MPI-M (2008-09-30)
!!  - inserted Namelists originally found at hydro_control
!!  - split out a Namelist for horizontal diffusion
!!  Modification by M. Giorgetta, MPI-M (2009-02-23)
!!  - lidealized renamed to ltestcase
!!  Modification by M. Giorgetta, MPI-M (2009-02-25)
!!  - revision of &run_ctl
!!    - rename ltracer to ltransport
!!    - rename tracer_ctl to transport_ctl
!!    - added lhydrostatic
!!    - renamed hydro_ctl to hydrostatic_ctl
!!    - renamed setup_hydro to setup_hydrostatic
!!    - moved nlev from namelist hydrostatic_ctl to namelist run_ctl
!!    - removed nlev_ocean from ocean_ctl
!!    - added iequations
!!    - added latmosphere
!!  Modification by Almut Gassmann, MPI-M (2009-03-05)
!!  - start preparation for NH Model
!!  Modification by M. Giorgetta, MPI-M (2009-03-22)
!!  - add parameters 'modelname' and 'modelversion'
!!  Modification by Almut Gassmann, MPI-M (2009-10-05)
!!  - remove luse_rbf_vec_int.. switches
!!  Modification by Stephan Lorenz, MPI-M (2010-02-23)
!!  - extension of namelist ocean_ctl and default vertical z-levels
!!  Modification by Daniel Reinert, DWD (2010-06-07)
!!  - added variables iqv, iqc, iqr, iqi, iqs which can be used to
!!    acess the desired fields in the 4D tracer array
!!  Modification by Kristina Froehlich, DWD (2010-09-22)
!!  - added variables itconv, itccov, itrad, itsso plus the respective field
!!    to  introduce the calling-time control array
!!  Modification by Constantin Junk, MPI-M (2011-02-22)
!!  - separated run_ctl and the subroutine setup_run
!!    into new module 'mo_run_nml'.
!!  Modification by Constantin Junk, MPI-M (2011-02-24)
!!  - separated io_ctl and the subroutine setup_io
!!    into new module 'mo_io_nml'.
!!  Modification by Constantin Junk, MPI-M (2011-03-18)
!!  - separated mpiom_phy_ctl, ocean_ctl und octst_ctl and
!!    the subroutine setup_ocean into new module 'mo_ocean_nml'
!!  Modification by Constantin Junk, MPI-M (2011-03-23)
!!  - removed hydrostatic_ctl and setup_hydrostatic. Included
!!  Modification by Constantin Junk, MPI-M (2011-03-28)
