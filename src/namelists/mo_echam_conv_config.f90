  !! The configuration state (variable).
  !! So far we have not tried to use different configurations for different
  !! domains (grid levels) in experiments with nesting. Thus the variable
  !! is declared as a scalar. Later it might be changed into an array of
  !! shape (/n_dom/) or (/MAX_DOM/).
