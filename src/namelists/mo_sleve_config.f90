  TYPE :: t_sleve_config

    ! a) Parameters specifying the distrubution of the coordinate surfaces
    !     (the initializations are a workaround for a NEC compiler bug)

    REAL(wp):: min_lay_thckn = 1._wp  ! Layer thickness of lowermost level
    REAL(wp):: stretch_fac   = 1._wp  ! Factor for stretching/squeezing the model layer distribution
    REAL(wp):: top_height    = 1._wp  ! Height of model top

    ! b) Parameters for SLEVE definition

    REAL(wp):: decay_scale_1 = 1._wp  ! Decay scale for large-scale topography component
    REAL(wp):: decay_scale_2 = 1._wp  ! Decay scale for small-scale topography component
    REAL(wp):: decay_exp     = 1._wp  ! Exponent for decay function
    REAL(wp):: flat_height   = 1._wp  ! Height above which the coordinate surfaces are exactly flat
                                      ! additional feature not available in the standard
                                      ! SLEVE definition
