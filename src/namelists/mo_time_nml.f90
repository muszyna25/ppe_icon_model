  !!
  !! @par Revision History
  !!  Reading of the namelist and checking of the validity were
  !!  in some other modules in the earlier version of the shallow water model.
  !!  Moved to this module by Hui Wan, MPI-M (2007-02-23)
  !!  The character parameter <i>routine</i> was introduced and used
  !!  for error information by Hui Wan, MPI-M (2007-02-23).
  !!  Modified by Almut Gassmann, MPI-M (2008-09-23)
  !!  - introduced  lidealized and lshallow_water
  !!  Modified by Marco Giorgetta, MPI-M (2009-02-23)
  !!  - lidealized replaced by ltestcase
  !!  Modification by Constantin Junk, MPI-M (2010-02-22)
  !!  - changes to consistency checks
