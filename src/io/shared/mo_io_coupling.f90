!! @brief Routines for the initialisation of YAC on IO processes
!!
!! @author
!!  Rene Redler (MPI-M)
!!
!! The purpose of routines construct_io_coupler and destruct_io_coupler is
!! to initialise YAC on asynchronous IO processes. The YAC initialisation,
!! and search are collective operations in the MPI sense. Thus all MPI processes
!! must call yac_finit and yac_fsearch (and for symmetry yac_ffinialze)
!! Currently, the IO processes do not receive any fields via YAC for output.
!! Therefore, yac_fsearch is called with an empty list of fields.
