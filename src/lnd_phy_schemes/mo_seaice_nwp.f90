!! The main program unit of the sea-ice parameterization scheme for NWP. 
!! It contains two procedures, viz., 
!! SUBROUTINE seaice_init_nwp
!! that initializes the scheme and performs some consistency checks, 
!! and 
!! SUBROUTINE seaice_timestep_nwp
!! that advances prognostic variables of the sea-ice scheme one time step.
!!
!! The present sea-ice parameterization scheme is a bulk thermodynamic (no rheology) scheme 
!! intended for use in NWP and similar applications.  
!! The scheme is based on a self-similar parametric representation (assumed shape) of the
!! evolving temperature profile within the ice and on the integral heat budget of the ice slab. 
!! The scheme carries ordinary differential equations (in time) 
!! for the ice surface temperature and the ice thickness. 
!! An explicit Euler scheme is used for time advance.
!! In the current configuration of the scheme, snow over sea ice is not treated explicitly. 
!! The effect of snow above the ice is accounted for implicitely (parametrically) through 
!! an empirical temperature dependence of the ice surface albedo with respect to solar radiation. 
!! For the "sea water" type ICON grid boxes, the snow thickness is set to zero and
!! the snow surface temperature is set equal to the ice surface temperature
!! (both temperatures are set equal to the fresh-water freezing point if the ice is absent).
!! Prognostic equations for the ice thickness and the ice surface temperature are solved 
!! for the ICON grid boxes with the ice fraction 
!! (area fraction of a given model grid box of the type "sea water" that is covered by ice)
!! that exceeds a threshold value of 0.03. Otherwise, the grid box is treated as ice-free.
!! The ice fraction is determined on the basis of observational data
!! by the data assimilation scheme and is kept constant over the entire model forecast period. 
!! However, if the ice melts out during the forecast, the ice fraction is reset to zero. 
!! This is done within 
!! SUBROUTINE <name>, 
!! where the grid-box-mean (aggregated) surface temperature 
!! and grid-box-mean surface fluxes are computed.
!! If the ICON grid box is set ice-free during the initialization, 
!! no ice is created over the forecast period. 
!! If observational data indicate open water conditions for a given ICON grid box,
!! residual ice from the previous model run is removed, 
!! i.e. the ice thickness is set to zero and 
!! the ice surface temperature is set to the fresh-water freezing point. 
!! The newly formed ice has the surface temperature equal to the salt-water freezing point 
!! and the thickness of 0.5 m. The new ice is formed instantaneously 
!! if the data assimilation scheme indicates the presence of ice in a given ICON grid box
!! but there was no ice in that grid box during the previous model run. 
!! Prognostic ice thickness is limited by a maximum value of 3 m and a minimum value of 0.05 m. 
!! Constant values of the density, molecular heat conductivity, specific heat of ice, the latent
!! heat of fusion, and the salt-water freezing point are used.
!!
!! A detailed description of the sea ice scheme is given in
!! Mironov, D., B. Ritter, J.-P. Schulz, M. Buchhold, M. Lange, and E. Machulskaya, 2012:
!! Parameterization of sea and lake ice in numerical weather prediction models
!! of the German Weather Service.
!! Tellus A, 64, 17330. doi:10.3402/tellusa.v64i0.17330
!!
!! The present seas ice scheme (with minor modifications) 
!! is also implemented into the NWP models GME and COSMO 
!! (see Mironov et al. 2012, for details).

  !! Prognostic variables of the sea-ice parameterization scheme are initialized 
  !! and some consistency checks are performed. 
  !!
  !! The procedure arguments are arrays (vectors) of the sea-ice scheme prognostic variables
  !! and of the sea-ice fraction. The vector length is equal to the number of ICON grid boxes
  !! (within a given block)
  !! where sea ice is present, i.e. where the sea-ice fraction exceeds its minimum value.
  !! First, the sea-ice fraction is checked. 
  !! If a value less than a minimum threshold value is found 
  !! (indicating that a grid box is declared as partially ice-covered but no sea ice 
  !! should be present), an error message is sent and the model abort is called.
  !! Next, "new" ice is formed in the grid boxes where "old" value of the sea-ice thickness
  !! is less than a minimum threshold value (i.e. there was no ice at the end 
  !! of the the previous model run). The newly formed ice has the surface temperature equal 
  !! to the salt-water freezing point and the thickness of 0.5 m. 
  !! Then, the ice thickness is limited from above and below 
  !! by the maximum and minimum threshold values, 
  !! and the ice surface temperature is limited from above by the fresh-water freezing point. 
  !! These security measures (taken for each grid box where sea ice is present)
  !! are required to avoid non-allowable values of prognostic variables 
  !! that may occure due to a loss of accuracy during the model IO 
  !! (e.g. due to GRIB encoding and decoding).  
  !! Finally, the snow thickness is set to zero, and
  !! the snow surface temperature is set equal to the ice surface temperature 
  !! (recall that snow over sea ice is not treated explicitly).

  !! Prognostic variables of the sea-ice scheme are advanced one time step.
  !!
  !! Ordinary differential equations (in time) for the ice surface temperature and 
  !! the ice thickness are solved using an explicit Euler scheme for time advance.
  !! The shape factor for the temperature profile within the ice and the derivative of the 
  !! temperature profile shape function at the underside of the ice are functions of the ice 
  !! thickness (see Mironov et al. 2012, for details).  
  !! Optionally, constant values of the shape factor and of the shape-function derivative
  !! corresponding to the linear temperature profile within the ice 
  !! (cf. the sea ice schemes of GME and COSMO) can be used 
  !! (as there is no logical switch to activate this option, changes in the code should be made).
  !! In the regime of ice growth or melting from below, the solution may become numerically 
  !! unstable if the ice is thin. In such a case, a quasi-steady heat transfer through the ice 
  !! is assumed and the differential equation for the ice surface temperature 
  !! is reduced to an algebraic relation. 
  !! In the current configuration of the sea ice scheme, snow over ice is not treated explicitly. 
  !! The effect of snow is accounted for implicitely through an empirical temperature dependence 
  !! of the ice surface albedo with respect to solar radiation. 
  !! For the "sea water" type grid boxes, the snow thickness is set to zero and
  !! the snow surface temperature is set equal to the ice surface temperature.
  !! As the coupling between the sea ice and the sea water beneath is not considered, 
  !! the heat flux from water to ice is neglected.
  !! Prognostic ice thickness is limited by a maximum value of 3 m and a minimum value of 0.05 m. 
  !! No ice is created during the forecast period. 
  !! If the ice melts out during the forecast (i.e. the ice becomes thinner than 0.05 m), 
  !! the ice tickness is set to zero and 
  !! the ice surface temperatures is set to the fresh-water freezing point.
  !! The procedure arguments are arrays (vectors) of the sea-ice scheme prognostic variables
  !! and of the components of the heat balance at the ice upper surface, 
  !! i.e. the fluxes of sensible and latent heat, the net flux of long-wave radiation,
  !! and the net flux of solar radiation (with due regard for the ice surface albedo).
  !! Fluxes are positive when directed downward.
  !! The vector length is equal to the number of model grid boxes 
  !! (within a given block) where sea ice is present  
  !! (i.e. where the sea-ice fraction exceeds its minimum threshold value).
  !! The time tendecies of the ice thickness, the ice surface temperature, 
  !! the snow thickness and the snow surface temperature are also computed. 
  !! These are optional arguments of the procedure.
