!! @brief Contains surface type (tile) indices used by the 
!! turbulent mixing parameterization.
!!
!! @remarks
!! In the turbulent mixing parameterization some of the prognostic
!! variables (currently u, v, T, q, TKE) are subject to turbulent tranfer
!! between the Earth's surface and the lowest model level.
!! Boundary condition of this transfer is formulated separately
!! for different surface types. This module contains parameters
!! specifying how many different types are considered in a particular
!! simulation (variable "nsfc_type"), and their corresponding indices
!! (e.g., iwtr for water, ilnd for land, etc.). In addition, the
!! aggregated grid-box mean value is given the index "igbm".
