!!               The module <i>mo_model_import_domain</i>.
!!
!!               The module <i>mo_model_import_domain</i>
!! provides functionality to import information about the models computational
!! domain. This information is read from several files that were generated by
!! the patch generator programm. The data types describing the model domain are
!! contained in <i>mo_domain_model</i>.
!!
!! @par Revision History
!! Initial version  by: Peter Korn,  MPI-M, Hamburg, June 2005
!! Modification by Thomas Heinze (2006-02-21):
!! - renamed m_modules to mo_modules
!! Modification by Thomas Heinze (2006-09-20):
!! - added routine grid_and_patch_diagnosis
!! Modification by Pilar Ripodas, DWD, (2007-01-31)
!! - addapted to the new TYPE grid_edges (system_orientation added)
!! Modification by Peter Korn,  MPI-M, (2006-12)
!! - implementation of topography and boundary treatment, i.e.
!!   initialization of the grid & patch components that carry
!!   information about topography and the lateral boundaries of
!!   the domain; this is not related to patch boundaries.
!!   topography can either be computed by analytical l,eans or
!!   by reading from database files.
!! Modification by Hui Wan, MPI-M, (2007-02-23)
!! - Subroutine <i>init_import</i> was changed to <i>setup_grid</i>.
!!   Namelist hierarchy_ini was renamed to <i>grid_ctl</i>, moved
!!   from <i>mo_io_utilities</i> to this module and now read from
!!   an external file in subroutine <i>setup_grid</i>.
!! - Some changes in <i>init_ocean_patch_component</i> after
!!   discussion with Peter.
!! - Calculation of the min. primal edge length was added to
!!   <i>import_patches</i>. However, shouldn't it be an array with
!!   one element for each patch, rather than a scalar?
!! Modification by P. Ripodas, DWD, (2007-03-14):
!! - Now the output of "import_patches" is the min_dual_edge_lenght
!!   instead of the min_primal_edge_lenght. It will be used to set
!!   the horizontal diffusion parameter. Now it is done as it was
!!   in the prototype.
!! Modification by Almut Gassmann, MPI-M (2007-04)
!! - removed loptimize to make compatible with new grid generator
!! - removed itoa for good programming style
!! - reorganized patch input to be compatible with the new patch generator
!! - cleaning up "destruct_patches"
!! Modification by Almut Gassmann, MPI-M (2007-04-13)
!! - remove grid type and perform related adaptations
!!   (grid information comes now inside a patch)
!! - changed subroutine name form setup_grid to setup_files
!! Modified by Hui Wan, MPI-M, (2008-04-04)
!!  - control variable loce renamed locean
!!  - topography_file_dir renamed topo_file_dir
!!  - for the hydro_atmos, control variable testtype renamed ctest_name.
!! Modified by Almut Gassmann, MPI-M, (2008-04-23)
!!  - itopo distinguishes now shallow water (itopo=1) orography function
!!    from hydro_atmos orography function (itopo=2)
!! Modification by Jochen Foerstner, DWD, (2008-07-16)
!!  - new fields in the derived type for the edges:
!!    grid_edges%primal_cart_normal (Cartesian normal to edge),
!!    grid_edges%quad_idx, grid_edges%quad_area and grid_edges%quad_orientation
!!    (indices of edges and area of the quadrilateral formed by two adjacent cells)
!!    up to now these new fields are initialized in the new routines
!!    calculate_primal_cart_normal and init_quad_twoadjcells
!!    rather than read from a grid/patch file.
!! Modification by Almut Gassmann, MPI-M, (2008-09-21)
!!  - remove reference to mask and height files, they are never used
!!  - use i_cell_type to distinguish cells as triangles or hexagons
!! Modification by Almut Gassmann, MPI-M (2008-10-30)
!!  - add subroutine init_coriolis to initialize Coriolis parameter
