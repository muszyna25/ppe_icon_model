!! @par Revision History
!! Developed  by Luca Bonaventura and Will Sawyer (2002-4).
!! Modified to ProTeX-style by  Luca Bonaventura and Thomas Heinze (2004).
!! Adapted to new data structure by Thomas Heinze,
!! Peter Korn and Luca Bonaventura (2005).
!! Modification by Thomas Heinze (2006-02-21):
!! - renamed m_modules to mo_modules
!! Modification by Thomas Heinze (2006-07-05):
!! - modified cell2edge_lin_int_coeff
!! - created cc_dot_product
!! Modification by Peter Korn and Luca Bonaventura(2006-07-28):
!! - moved several auxiliary functions to mo_math_utilities
!! - introduced recoded rbf interpolation for vector fields
!! - added lraviart switch to force RT interpolation to be used
!! Modification by Thomas Heinze  and Luca Bonaventura(2006-10-05):
!! - merged with 'Milano' version by P. Korn
!! Modification by Pilar Ripodas (2006-11):
!! - new subroutine rbf_vec_interpol_car with the cartesian
!!   coordinates as output
!! Modification by Peter Korn, MPI-M, (2006-11-23):
!! - replacements in TYPE patch: ic by l2g_c, ie by l2g_e, iv by l2g_v,
!!   iic by g2l_c, iie by g2l_e, iiv by g2l_v

!!   dt_tan_vec_old and dt_tan_rt_vec_old and should not be used
!! - New subroutines dt_tan_vec_h and dt_tan_vec_kin and
!!   dt_tan_vec_gen are produced and

!!  Modification by Peter Korn, MPI-M (2007-02)
!!  Modification by Hui Wan, MPI-M (2007-02-22)

!!  - substruct the outgoing component of the reconstructed
!!    vector in subroutine "rbf_vec_interpol_car"
!!  Modification by Thomas Heinze, DWD (2007-08-02)
!!  - replaced rbf_kern_dim by rbf_kern_dim_c
!!  - replaced rbf_vec_dim by rbf_vec_dim_c
!!  - replaced rbf_mat_dim by rbf_mat_dim_c
!!  - replaced rbf_vec_scale by rbf_vec_scale_c
!!  - replaced rbf_vec_pdeg_c by rbf_vec_rbf_vec_pdeg_c_c
!!  Modification by Hui Wan, MPI-M (2007-08-02; 2007-11-30)
!!  - added interpolation coefficients c_aw_e and e_aw_c
!!    and the initialization subroutine aw_int_coeff.
!!  - added subroutine edges2cells_scalar
!!  Modification by Jochen Foerstner, DWD (2008-05-05)
!!  - four new subroutines
!!      rbf_vec_index_vertex
!!      rbf_vec_compute_coeff_vertex
!!      rbf_vec_interpol_car_vertex
!!      prepare_simpson
!!    to reconstruct a Cartesian vector at the vertices using
!!    RBF interpolation and to prepare quadrature via the
!!    Simpson's rule.
!!  Modification by Marco Restelli, MPI (2008-07-17)
!!  - included the subroutines
!!      cells2vertex_scalar, cells2vertex_coeff, ravtom_normgrad2,
!!      ls_normgrad2, ls_normgrad2_ii, edges2points_vector
!!    to compute polynomial fitting with sufficient accuracy as
!!    required in SW-alpha model.
!!  Modification by Jochen Foerstner, DWD (2008-09-12)
!!  - moved SUBROUTINE ravtom_normgrad2 to mo_math_operators
!!    because of conflicting use statements.
!!  Modification by Almut Gassmann, MPI-M (2008-10-09)
!!  - added features for helicity bracket reconstruction
!!  Modification by Guenther Zaengl, DWD (2008-10-23)
!!  - added interpolation routines needed for mesh refinement
!!  Modification by Almut Gassmann, MPI-M (2009-01-29)
!!  - conforming scalar interpolation routines and adjusting coefficients
!!  Modification by Guenther Zaengl, DWD (2009-02-11)
!!  - all routines needed for grid refinement are moved into the new
!!    module mo_grf_interpolation
!!  Modification by Guenther Zaengl, DWD (2009-02-13)
!!  - RBFs are changed to direct reconstruction of velocity components on
!!    the sphere, avoiding the detour over the 3D Cartesian space
!!  Modification by Almut Gassmann, DWD (2009-03-17)
!!  - remove lraviart
!!  Modification by Almut Gassmann, MPI-M (2009-04-23)
!!  - remove all Raviart Thomas stuff, add edge to verts averaging
!!  Modification by Daniel Reinert, DWD (2009-07-20)
!!  - added subroutine grad_lsq_compute_coeff_cell to prepare
!!    (2D) gradient reconstruction at circumcenter via the least squares
!!    method.
!!  Modification by Almut Gassmann, MPI-M (2009-10-05)
!!  - set RBF vec dimensions to predefined values (edges:4,vertices:6,cells:9);
!!    All other switches and belongings are deleted. The reason is that
!!    the Hollingsworth instability requires 4 edges, cell reconstruction
!!    is only needed for output and vertices are only used in the bracket
!!    version, where the dimension at the vertices should be 6
!!  Modification by Daniel Reinert, DWD (2009-12-10)
!!  - replaced grad_lsq_compute_coeff_cell by lsq_compute_coeff_cell
!!    which initializes either a second order or a third order least squares
!!    reconstruction.
!!  Modification by Almut Gassmann, MPI-M (2010-01-12)
!!  - generalize p_int%primal_normal_ec and p_int%edge_cell_length to hexagons
