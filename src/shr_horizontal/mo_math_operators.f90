!!
!! @par Revision History
!!  Developed  by Luca Bonaventura and Will Sawyer (2002-4).
!!  Modified to ProTeX-style by  Luca Bonaventura and Thomas Heinze (2004).
!!  Adapted to new data structure by Thomas Heinze,
!!  Peter Korn and Luca Bonaventura (2005).
!!  Modification by Thomas Heinze (2006-02-21):
!!  - renamed m_modules to mo_modules
!!  Subroutine for divergence multiplied by area added by P.Korn (2006).
!!  Modification by Peter Korn, MPI-M, (2006-11-23):
!!  - replacements in TYPE patch: ic by l2g_c, ie by l2g_e, iv by l2g_v,
!!    iic by g2l_c, iie by g2l_e, iiv by g2l_v
!!  - replaced edge_index by edge_idx
!!  - replaced vertex_index by vertex_idx
!!  - replaced cell_index by cell_idx
!!  - replaced neighbor_index by neighbor_idx
!!  - replaced child_index by child_idx
!!  Modified by P Ripodas (2007-02):
!!  - include the system orientation factor in the vorticity term of nabla2_vec
!!  - solved errors in nabla4_vec and nabla4_scalar
!!  Modification by Peter Korn, MPI-M, (2006/2007):
!!  -operator overloading of curl operator and nabla2vec to handle atmosphere and ocean version
!!  -change of input/output arguments of subroutines: arrays of fixed size are
!!   changed to pointers, to avoid occurence of not-initialized numbers
!!  Modified by Almut Gassmann, MPI-M, (2007-04)
!!  - removed references to unused halo_verts
!!  - summing over all halos corresponding to different parallel patches
!!  Modified by Hui Wan, MPI-M, (2007-11)
!!  - added subroutine cell_avg
!!  Modified by Hui Wan, MPI-M, (2008-04-04)
!!  - control variable loce renamed locean
!!  Modification by Jochen Foerstner, DWD, (2008-05-05)
!!  - div and div_times_area are now generic subroutines
!!  - the divergence can now be computed either
!!    using the midpoint rule
!!    (div_midpoint, div_midpoint_times_area) or
!!    using the Simpson's rule
!!    (div_simpson, div_simpson_times_area)
!!  Modification by Jochen Foerstner, DWD, (2008-07-16)
!!  - introduction of several new operators (to be) used in combination with
!!    the tracer advection:
!!    grad_green_gauss_cell, grad_green_gauss_edge and div_quad_twoadjcells
!!    (for the new div operator there is again a version using the midpoint
!!    and a version using the Simpson's rule).
!!    The first operator is used to calculate a cell centered value of the
!!    gradient for the piecewise linear reconstruction. The second and third
!!    will be used in combination with the MPDATA scheme. Both deal with the
!!    quadrilateral control volumes formed by two adjacent triangles.
!!  Modification by Marco Restelli, MPI (2008-07-17)
!!  - included subroutine dtan.
!!  Modification by Jochen Foerstner, DWD (2008-09-12)
!!  - moved SUBROUTINE ravtom_normgrad2 from mo_interpolation to this module
!!    because of conflicting use statements.
!!  Modification by Jochen Foerstner, DWD (2008-09-16)
!!  - removed SUBROUTINE ravtom_normgrad2 (not used)
!!  Modification by Daniel Reinert, DWD (2009-07-20)
!!  - added subroutine grad_lsq_cell for gradient reconstruction via the
!!    least-squares method and grad_green_gauss_gc_cell for Green-Gauss
!!    gradient in geographical coordinates
!!  Modification by Daniel Reinert, DWD (2009-12-14)
!!  - renamed grad_lsq_cell -> recon_lsq_cell_l
!!  Modification by Leonidas Linardakis, MPI-M (2010-21-01)
!!  - splitted mo_math_operators into submodules
!!
