!! These had originally been included in mo_grf_interpolation but then were
!! packed into a separate module to clean up the code

!! @par Revision History
!! Created by Guenther Zaengl, DWD (2009-02-09)
!! Modification by Guenther Zaengl, DWD (2009-06-22)
!! - preparation for generalized grid refinement (affects all subroutines)
!! Modification by Constantin Junk, MPI-M (2011-05-05)
!! - moved gridref_ctl namelist variables to mo_gridref_nml
