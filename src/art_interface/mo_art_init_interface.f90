!! Provides interface to the ART-routine for initializing ART type structures. 
!!
!! This module provides an interface to the ART-routine art_init_all_dom
!! The interface is written in such a way, that ICON will compile and run 
!! properly, even if the ART-routines are not available at compile time.
