!! @brief Module to provide Monte Carlo samples based on cloud fraction
!!
!! @remarks
!!   This module draws Monte Carlo samples from profiles of the atmospheric
!!   state and on overlap assumption ( 1=max-ran, 2=maximum, 3=random). 
!!   Users provide profiles of cloud fraction and in-cloud optical thickness. 
!!   A single sample is drawn; cloud fraction is either 1 or 0 and optical 
!!   thickness is set to 0 where cloud fraction is 0.
