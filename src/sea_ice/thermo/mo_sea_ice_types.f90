!! This module provides definition of types of the ICON ocean surface module,
!! i.e. the sea ice and coupling between the atmopshere and the ocean model.
!!
!! Types are grouped as follows:
!! - Sea ice:                                   t_sea_ice, t_sea_ice_budgets
!! - Surface fluxes (categories):               t_atmos_fluxes
