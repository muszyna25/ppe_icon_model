#
# General
# -------
# NCL is probably the plotting software on which we want to rely mostly
# for standard plotting of model data. The advantages are that (1) NCL
# has an active development team, (2) a broad user community, (3) can be
# used without licence fee, and (4) can handle data on unstructured grids,
# which is iomportant for ICON.

#
# Plotting scripts
# -----------------------------------
#
# 1. icon_vectorplots.ncl
#   still needs (converts) lat/lon data but are able to overlay the nested domain on the globe
#
# 2. icon_triangles_mesh.ncl
#    able to plot fields of the unstructured grid
#
# 3. icon_triangles_polygons.ncl
#    plots the triangles for each colour levels which make the procedurea bit lenghty
#    but can be used for "triangle-wise-debugging"
#
# 4. vertical_transection.ncl
#    draws a crosssection through any arbitrary domain, this plot uses currently only
#    temperature. It is not possible to plot vector arrows on the figure.

#    getting started
#
# 1.  edit your working directory(Diri) and filename (FileName*), and the output file (GraphicFile)
# 2.  edit variable, level , time step as you want
# 3.  run ncl
