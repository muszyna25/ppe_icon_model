This is a first draft of a git merge review tool. It is only tested on
xceXXX and lceXXX at DWD and on my Mac. Testing and updating the
module provided python versions need to be done.

There are certain requirements:

1) pygtk is needed (due to the old system installations available that
   was the lowest common denominator).

2) gitpython

   There is a version installed at DWD in my local home directory,
   which I added to the scripts load path so that it can be used by
   others.

   For python 2.6 the following steps have to be performed:

   wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
   python ./get-pip.py --user
   export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
   pip install --user gitpython
   pip install --user ordereddict
   pip install --user unittest2

   For python 2.7 the following steps have to be performed (pip and
   ordereddict are part of python as of 2.7):

   wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
   python ./get-pip.py --user
   export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
   pip install --user gitpython
   pip install --user unittest2

3) Select a grpahical difftool. A selection available could be retrieved with

   git difftool --tool-help

   You need to change your copy's predefined difftool around line 15
   of the script.

Feel free to contact me by email (luis.kornblueh@mpimet.mpg.de). This
tool is considered to be in alpha state!
