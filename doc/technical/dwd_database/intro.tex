\chapter{Introduction}

The \textbf{ICO}sahedral \textbf{N}onhydrostatic model ICON is the new global numerical 
weather prediction model at DWD. It will become operational at 2015-01-20, replacing the current 
operational global model GME. The ICON modelling system as a whole is developed jointly by DWD and the 
Max-Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg (MPI-M). While ICON is the new working horse 
for short and medium range global weather forecast at DWD, it will serve as the core of a new climate 
modelling system at MPI-M.

From 2014-01-20 on, ICON analysis and forecast fields will serve as initial and boundary data for
\begin{itemize}
 \item the regional model COSMO-EU
 \item RLMs (\textbf{R}elocated \textbf{L}ocal \textbf{M}odel) of the German armed forces
 \item DWD's wave models
\end{itemize}

This document provides some basic information about ICON's horizontal and vertical grid structure, 
numerical algorithms and physical parameterizations (the latter two are planned but not yet available). 
Furthermore, it provides an overview about the available ICON analysis and forecast fields stored in the 
data base SKY at DWD. Some examples on how to read these data from the data base are given as well.
