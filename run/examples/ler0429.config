# ICON-ESM R2B3 atmosphere coupled to R2B4 ocean

#
# This file describes a coupled experiment test setup on a R2B3 grid based on
# the non-hydrostatic atmosphere with ECHAM physics and the hydrostatic ocean
# running on an R2B4 grid. The atmosphere is initialized from analysis files and
# using constant pre-industrial (PI-control) boundary conditions for the year
# 1850:
# - spectral solar irradiation
# - well mixed greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, N2O, no CFCs
# - O3 concentration
# - SST and sea ice are transferred via YAC from the ocean.
# - and no (!) aerosols
#
# A test version for HD is included. Model is water mass conserving now.
#
# Here, ocean is initialized from long (3600y) tuning run with good AMOC and sea-ice.
# Hamocc is initialized with cmip6 data interpolated to icon-ocean grid.
#
#
# The coupling:
#
# atmosphere -> ocean:
# . surface_downward_eastward_stress
# . surface_downward_northward_stress
# . surface_fresh_water_flux
# . total_heat_flux
# . atmosphere_sea_ice_bundle
# . river_runoff
# . co2_mixing_ratio
#
# ocean -> atmosphere:
# . sea_surface_temperature
# . eastward_sea_water_velocity
# . northward_sea_water_velocity
# . ocean_sea_ice_bundle
# . 10m_wind_speed
# . co2_flux
