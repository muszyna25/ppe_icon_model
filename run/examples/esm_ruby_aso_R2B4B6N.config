# This file describes a coupled experiment setup on a R2B4 grid based on the non-hydrostatic
# atmosphere with ECHAM physics and the hydrostatic ocean running on a R2B6 grid. The atmosphere
# is intialized from analysis files and using transient boundary conditions (1850) for:
# - spectral solar irradiation
# - well mixed greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, N2O, no CFCs
# - O3 concentration
# - SST and sea ice are transferred via YAC from the ocean.
# - and no (!) aerosols
#
# Here, the ocean is already spun up from PHC3.0 (Levitus) climatology for several centuries
# initialiseOcean="fromRestart"
# initialiseOcean="fromClimatology" is possible, see below.
#
# The coupling:
#
# atmosphere -> ocean:
# . surface_downward_eastward_stress
# . surface_downward_northward_stress
# . surface_fresh_water_flux
# . total_heat_flux
# . atmosphere_sea_ice_bundle
# . river_runoff
#
# ocean -> atmosphere:
# . sea_surface_temperature
# . eastward_sea_water_velocity
# . northward_sea_water_velocity
# . ocean_sea_ice_bundle
# . 10m_wind_speed
#
# currently not activated for coupling:
# . co2_mixing_ratio
# . co2_flux
