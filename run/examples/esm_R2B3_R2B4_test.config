# ICON-ESM R2B3 atmosphere coupled to R2B4 ocean
#
# author_list="Monika Esch, Rene Redler, Stephan Lorenz, Lennart Ramme"
#
# This file describes a coupled experiment test setup on a R2B3 grid based on
# the non-hydrostatic atmosphere with ECHAM physics and the hydrostatic ocean
# running on an R2B4 grid. The atmosphere is initialized from analysis files and
# using constant pre-industrial (PI-control) boundary conditions for the year
# 1850:
# - spectral solar irradiation
# - well mixed greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, N2O, no CFCs
# - O3 concentration
# - SST and sea ice are transferred via YAC from the ocean.
# - and no (!) aerosols
#
# A test version for HD is included. Model is water mass conserving now.
# Hamocc can be turned on, but is deactivated by default
#
# Here, the ocean is already spun up from Levitus climatology for 250 years.
# initializing the Ocean from long tuning run (3600y) and hamocc variables from cmip6 restart is
# is possible (initialiseOcean="fromRestartwithHamocc")
# initialiseOcean="fromClimatology" is possible, see below.
#
# The coupling:
#
# atmosphere -> ocean:
# . surface_downward_eastward_stress
# . surface_downward_northward_stress
# . surface_fresh_water_flux
# . total_heat_flux
# . atmosphere_sea_ice_bundle
# . river_runoff
#
# ocean -> atmosphere:
# . sea_surface_temperature
# . eastward_sea_water_velocity
# . northward_sea_water_velocity
# . ocean_sea_ice_bundle
# . 10m_wind_speed
#
# currently not activated for coupling:
# . co2_mixing_ratio
# . co2_flux
#
# Test mode: run for one year with monthly restarts and daily output values
