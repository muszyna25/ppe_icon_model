  DWD computing environment.




#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

General Remarks:

Sections A) - C) are tested for the following configurations:
(valid for revision 3272 on "trunk/icon-dev")

- "./configure" + "./build_command" on Blizzard, Tornado and Squall
- experiment "exp.test_hat_jww.run" on Blizzard, Tornado and Squall
- "make index" on Squall and Tornado
- "make doc" tested on Squall (software missing on Tornado)



#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


A) Building the model
=====================

1. Configure the Makefile and make the executables
--------------------------------------------------

The Autoconf configuration system is used to analyze the computer 
architecture (hardware and software) and to set user specified 
preferences, e.g. for the compiler.  These preferences are read 
from config/mh-<OS>, where <OS> is the identified operating system.
If your OS is missing, make your own based on the given mh-<OS> files.
If different compilers are available, the mh-<OS> file may contain 
a case construct to distinguish them.

On tornado.dkrz.de, which has a Linux operating system, the mh-linux
file is relevant. On Tornado the following compilers are available: 
"gcc" (=default), "nag", "intel", "pgi", and "sun".

Use "./configure" to generate the Makefile for the "gcc" compiler, and to 
create the system specific "build" directory tree with the subordinate 
Makefiles:

% ./configure

Now use "./build_command" to compile the source codes and build the model executables:

% ./build_command

Note:
1. For using other compilers, use:
      % ./configure --with-fortran=<compiler>
   with <compiler> in {gcc,nag,intel,pgi,sun}.

2. Instead of using "./configure" and "./build_command" you may also use:
      % ./target_confmake.ksh <target>
   <target> selects the machine-compiler combination. On Tornado
   <target> can be chosen from {tornado,tornado_gcc,tornado_nag,etc}.
   The target must be defines in the database file "target_database_ksh".

3. If you wish to reconfigure the build then it is advisable to make a clean
   start by giving
     %make distclean

2. Generate html documentation
------------------------------

2.1 HTML-ized source code

Convert source code files to html files, with linked references
to modules, subroutines, functions, etc., for source code viewing
in web browsers. The html-ized source code is color coded for better
legibility.

% make index

Open html/index.html in your browser.

2.2 Doxygen documentation

Doxygen is a tool to extract lists of types, variables, subroutines, variables 
etc. from Fortran code. Additionally, Doxgen can generate graphs of calling
or called subroutine. Doxygen also html-izes and color-codes the source code.

If the "doxygen" software and other software used by doxygen is available 
(this is not the case on Tornado), then make an html-formatted Doxygen 
documentation:

On Squall: % make doc

This generates files in "doc/html/". Open doc/html/index.html file in
your web browser.


B) Construct grids
==================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please note:

The following description is related to the MPI-M version of the ICON
grid generator. For remarks on the basic (slightly different) grid
creation procedure see the ICON user guide.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The ICON horizontal spherical grid is based on the projection of the icosahedron
on the sphere. The initial icosahedron grid is refined by <n>-secting the edges,
and further refinement is obtained by iteratively bisecting the created edges.
The grid produced at the <k> refining iteration is named "R<n>B<k>", and the
corresponding netcdf file is iconR<n>B<k>-grid.nc. The grid files, after their
creation,  are located in the ./grids folder.

ICON atmosphere grids of resolution R<m>B<nn> are created by the
"grid.create_atmo_grids.run". It generates 5 levels of icon grids using
spring dynamics and symmetry optimizations. In addition it creates an
hierarchy of three nested grids for the exp.nat_jww_nwp_mpiomp experiment.
The "grid.create_atmo_grids.run" is created automatically by the "./make_runscripts"
script. Give

% ./make_runscripts

To create the "grid.create_atmo_grids.run", it is located in the "./run" folder.

The script variable no_of_levels determines the horizontal resolution, and is
set to no_of_level=5, giving in the highest resolution the triangular grid R2B05
of 81920 triangles, with a mean distance of 70 km between triangle circumcenters,
where scalars are defined.

By default the grid files are stored in a directory "<ICON base dir>/grids/",
which is created first, if not existing. Use ncdump and an editor to view 
the content of the grid files, or use NCL or other graphics packages
enabled for viewing data, as e.g. cell area, on irregular grids.


C) Make experiments
===================

5. Make a run script
--------------------

To create the run scripts give

% ./make_runscripts

This process will create the run scripts for running the grid generator and
for runnig model experiments, for which experiment descriptor files exist in
the run/ directory. Experiment descriptor files are named "exp.<name>". These
exp-files are processed in the configuration sequence started by "./configure"
resulting in run scripts ready to be used on the current architecture. Run
scripts are named "exp.<name>.run". The list of generated run scripts is listed
at the end of the configuration process. For details on how to generate
run scripts manually, see run/README.

For the following the run script exp.test_hat_jww.run is used, which runs the
hydrostatic atmosphere on a triangular R2B04 grid with initial condition for
the Jablonowski Williamson baroclinic wave test.

This generates the run script run/exp.test_hat_jww.run. This script contains
architecture and site specific parameters for parallelization, vectorization,
etc. Read the run script.


6. Run the ICON model
---------------------

The model executable, the grid and the run script exist now. 
Start the run:

% cd run
% qsub exp.test_hat_jww.run
% cd ..

This produces a number of files in the experiment directory "$EXP", located in
"experiments/". Here "$EXP"="test_hat_jww". Raw data are stored in 
"test_hat_jww_R2B04L31_0001.nc".

% cd experiments/test_hat_jww
% ls -1

You find the following files:
- HYB_PARAMS_31                  : Input , vertical coordinate table
- iconR2B04-grid.nc              : Input , horizontal grid
- NAMELIST_ICON                  : Input , namelist written by iconrun
- NAMELIST_ICON_output           : Output, namelist completed by model
- test_hat_jww_R2B04L31_0001.nc  : Output, raw data file in netcdf format
- total_integrals.dat            : Output, mass and energy error diagnostic

The raw data file name includes the experiment base name, the parameters
for the horizontal and vertical grid, as discussed above. Further a file 
counter "0001" indicates that this is the first raw data file 
(and in this case also the only one).

View the resulting data with NCL or other graphics packages enabled 
for processing data on unstructured grids, or use "cdo remapdis" to 
interpolate data from ICON grids to regular longitude latitude grids. 
Then use any convenient graphics package.

Here is the cdo remapping function to interpolate the data to the
Gaussian longitude-latitude grid associated with the T63 truncation.
The regular grid file can be viewed for example with GrADS.

% cdo -r remapdis,t63grid test_hat_jww_DOM01_R2B04L31_0001.nc test_hat_jww_DOM01_T63L31_0001.nc

N.B.: ICON data files include an absolute time axis, but GrADS
      needs a relative time axis. A conversion is achieved by
      the "-r" option used above with the cdo remapping command.


D) Running other real-data tests
================================

The general procedure of creating the ICON binary and setting up
real-data experiments is described in the ICON user manual,
cf. "doc/userguide".

Best practice settings for a real-data test case have been collected
in the experiment file "run/exp.nh_oper".  This run script is intended
to be used like in Section C.

Further stand-alone example scripts that contain basic namelist
settings as well as batch queuing settings for the DWD Cray XC30
platform can be found in the subdirectory
"/run/checksuite.xce.dwd.de/".  
See the comments in these run scripts for details.
