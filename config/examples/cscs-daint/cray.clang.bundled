# There is a known MPI library defect of external32 data packing, which is the
# only serialization guaranteed to be portable across different MPI
# communicators. This error is reported by the configure script of YAC unless
# we switch to the regular data packing routines by setting the argument
# "--disable-mpi-pack-external". Since the argument is not known by the
# configure script of ICON, we also set '--disable-option-checking' to prevent
# a warning message.
