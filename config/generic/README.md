# Introduction

This directory contains generic
[configure wrappers](../../README.md##configuration-wrappers) for ICON. The
wrappers are written with the assumption that the required
[software libraries](#software-libraries) are installed to the same prefix. The
prefix defaults to `/opt/local` on macOS and to `/usr` on other platforms. The
default values can be overridden by setting the environment variable
`ICON_SW_PREFIX`:
```bash
export ICON_SW_PREFIX='/path/to/icon/prerequisites'
```

# Prerequisites

This section provides a list of software required for building and running
ICON. The users can build and install (to the same prefix) the listed packages
manually or use a [package managers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager)
available for their platform. The basic instructions on how to do it on several
popular platforms are provided in section [Tested platforms](#tested-platforms).

## Building tools

- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make) v3.81+
- [Python](https://www.python.org) v2.6+ or v3.5+
- [Perl](https://www.perl.org) v5.10+
- Interoperable C and Fortran compilers (see also known
[compiler issues](https://gitlab.dkrz.de/icon/icon/-/boards/189))

## Software libraries

- [MPICH](https://www.mpich.org), [OpenMPI](https://www.open-mpi.org) or any
other [MPI](https://www.mpi-forum.org) implementation that provides compiler
wrappers `mpicc` and `mpif90` for C and Fortran, repsectively, as well as the
job launcher `mpiexec`.
- [HDF5](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5) with high-level interface (for
<a href="#netcdf-c">NetCDF-ะก</a>), thread-safety (for <a href="#cdo">CDO</a>),
and szlib filtering support (only C interface required, not a direct dependency
of ICON)
- <a name="netcdf-c"/> [NetCDF-C](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs)
with NetCDF-4 support
- [NetCDF-Fortran](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs-fortran)
- [ecCodes](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/ECC) with JPEG2000 support
(only C interface required)
- [BLAS](http://www.netlib.org/blas)
- [LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack)
- [Libxml2](http://www.xmlsoft.org)

See section [ICON dependencies](../../README.md#icon-dependencies) for more
details.

## Optional tools

- [KornShell](http://www.kornshell.com) for the
[generated runscripts](../../README.md#running)
- <a name="cdo"/> [CDO](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo) for pre- and
post-processing, also used by some of the
[generated runscripts](../../README.md#running)
- [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/) for the
[generated runscipts](../../README.md#running) in the case of
[out-of-source building](../../README.md#out-of-source-configuration-building)

# Tested platforms

This section provides basic but tested instructions on how to install most
commonly required subset of
[ICON dependencies](../../README.md#icon-dependencies) on different operating
systems using relevant
[package managers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager).

> **_NOTE:_** The current recommended version of [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) is
**6.x**. This is why most of the examples below are based on this version.

## [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org)

**Tested on `macOS Catalina 10.15.5`.**

Most of the required software packages are either already available on the
system or installed together with [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) and
[Command Line Tools for Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/),
which are [prerequsites for MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/install.php). The
rest of the required software can be installed by running the following
commands:

```bash
# Install building tools and ICON dependencies:
sudo port -N install       \
  gcc6                     \
  mpich-gcc6               \
  hdf5 +hl+threadsafe+szip \
  netcdf                   \
  netcdf-fortran +gcc6     \
  eccodes                  \
  libxml2

# Select the compiler and MPI compiler wrappers:
sudo port select --set gcc mp-gcc6
sudo port select --set mpi mpich-gcc6-fortran
hash -r

# Install optional tools:
sudo port -N install cdo +netcdf
```

## [Apt](https://wiki.debian.org/Apt)

**Tested on `Ubuntu Bionic Beaver 18.04.4 LTS`.**

```bash
# Install building tools and ICON dependencies:
sudo apt install -y \
  build-essential   \
  python3           \
  gcc-6             \
  gfortran-6        \
  libmpich-dev      \
  libhdf5-dev       \
  libnetcdf-dev     \
  libnetcdff-dev    \
  libeccodes-dev    \
  libblas-dev       \
  liblapack-dev     \
  libxml2-dev

# Select the compiler:
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-6 50 \
  --slave /usr/bin/gfortran gfortran /usr/bin/gfortran-6

# The command above can be reverted as follows:
# sudo update-alternatives --remove gcc /usr/bin/gcc-6

# Select MPI libraries and compiler wrappers
sudo update-alternatives --set mpi /usr/include/mpich
sudo update-alternatives --set mpirun /usr/bin/mpirun.mpich

# If the two non-interactive commands above do not work,
# try the interactive analogues:
# sudo update-alternatives --config mpirun
# sudo update-alternatives --config mpi

# Install optional tools:
sudo apt install -y ksh cdo
```

## [Pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman)

**Tested on `Arch Linux 2020.07.01`.**

```bash
# Install building tools and ICON dependencies:
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm \
  base-devel               \
  git                      \
  python                   \
  gcc-fortran              \
  openmpi                  \
  hdf5                     \
  netcdf                   \
  netcdf-fortran           \
  blas                     \
  lapack                   \
  libxml2

# Install ecCodes from the Arch User Repository:
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/openjpeg.git && cd openjpeg && makepkg -csi --noconfirm && cd ..
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/eccodes.git && cd eccodes && makepkg -csi --noconfirm && cd ..

# Install optional tools:
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm rsync ksh
```

> **_NOTE:_** [ecCodes package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/eccodes) is
currently broken and its `PKGBUILD` file might need to be extended with an
additional CMake argument `-DCMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS=-fallow-argument-mismatch`.

## [Spack](https://spack.io)

**Tested on `Ubuntu Bionic Beaver 18.04.4 LTS`.**

> **_NOTE:_** Spack has its own list of
[prerequisites](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#prerequisites).
Most of them are available out-of-the box on most Unix systems. On Ubuntu
systems, however, the users might need to install them separetly:
>```bash
>sudo apt install -y build-essential python3
>```

> **_NOTE:_** Although it is possible to install Fortran and C compilers with
Spack, the current recommendation is to do it using system's default package
manager. For example, on Ubuntu system, the users can run:
>```bash
>sudo apt install -y gcc-6 g++-6 gfortran-6
>```

> **_NOTE:_** Currently, Spack does not provide `KornShell`. The users are
recommended to install it using system's default package manager. For example,
on Ubuntu system, the users can run:
>```bash
>sudo apt install -y ksh
>```

```bash
# Install Spack:
git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git
. ./spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh

# Find the compilers;
spack compiler find

# Ignore the unneeded compilers:
spack compiler remove --all gcc@7:

# Install ICON dependencies:
spack install openmpi &&
  spack install netcdf-fortran ^hdf5+hl+szip+threadsafe &&
  spack install eccodes &&
  spack install netlib-lapack &&
  spack install libxml2

# Symlink the dependencies to a single prefix (e.g. to $HOME/icon-sw):
export ICON_SW_PREFIX="$HOME/icon-sw"
spack view symlink -i "$ICON_SW_PREFIX" \
  openmpi                               \
  netcdf-fortran                        \
  eccodes                               \
  netlib-lapack                         \
  libxml2

# Install optional tools:
spack install cdo ^hdf5+hl+szip+threadsafe
spack load cdo
```
